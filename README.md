# Banking-EDA-Insights
End-to-end EDA of banking data with SQL-Jupyter integration, data cleaning, and visualizations using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly. Key insights on customer behavior and campaign response. Includes a Power BI dashboard for KPI tracking and segmentation analysis.
### 📝 Description:
This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a banking customer dataset with the objective of uncovering actionable insights for targeted marketing. The workflow includes:

### 🔗 SQL Database Integration
Connected to the database directly in Jupyter using `sqlalchemy` and `pymysql` for seamless querying.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering (e.g., income band binning).

### 📊 Data Visualization
Generated rich visual insights using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` to understand customer demographics, campaign performance, and response patterns.

### 📌 KPI Dashboard in Power BI
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to track key metrics such as:

- Campaign response rate
- Customer segmentation by income, age, job, and education
- Loan/default influence on marketing outcomes

### 🛠️ Libraries Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
- `sqlalchemy`, `pymysql` – SQL integration
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` – data visualization
- `powerbi` – KPI dashboard reporting
